#  Hospital Management System – SQL Database Design Project

This repository contains all deliverables for my *Hospital Management System (HMS)* project, developed as part of **INFO 579: SQL/NoSQL Databases for Data and Information Sciences** at the University of Arizona.  

The project demonstrates the end-to-end design of a **relational database system** for managing key hospital operations, applying data modeling, normalization, SQL scripting, and documentation best practices.  

---

##  **Project Overview**

The Hospital Management System is designed to streamline core healthcare operations, including:  

- Patient registration and medical records  
- Doctor and nurse assignments  
- Surgery scheduling and treatment planning  
- Department management  
- Billing and payments  

The project follows **best practices in relational database design**, including:  

- Conceptual, logical, and physical modeling  
- Normalization to Third Normal Form (3NF)  
- SQL DDL and DML scripting  
- Data visualization with ER diagrams  
- Sample data preparation in Excel  

---

##  **Repository Structure**

Organized for easy navigation and reuse:  

### `/reports`
 Formal documentation in DOCX and PDF format, covering:  
- Initial project plans  
- Weekly progress updates  
- Final reports with design details  
- Field lists and table descriptions

**Example files:**  
- `HOSPITAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PROJECT.docx`  
- `INFO579_Week11_ProjectUpdate-2_Kolte.docx`  
- `INFO 579_KOLTE_Week16_Final Project Report.docx`  

---

### `/data`
 Excel files with sample data used for modeling and normalization.  
- Initial raw data collections  
- Cleaned and partially normalized versions  
- Fully normalized 3NF tables

**Example files:**  
- `DataSheet Rough.xlsx` – early attribute listing  
- `INFO579_KOLTE Week 8-Project Data.xlsx` – Week 8 deliverable with cleaned structure  
- `Project 3NF.xlsx` – final normalized schema  

---

### `/sql`
 SQL scripts demonstrating database implementation.  
- Table creation (DDL)  
- Data insertion and example queries (DML)  
- Multiple versions to show progress and refinement

**Example files:**  
- `sql project final Version.sql`  
- `sql project latest Version.sql`  

---

### `/diagrams`
 Visual ER diagrams of the data model.  
- Conceptual design  
- Logical schema  
- Physical database design

**Example files:**  
- `Conceptual Diagram update-2.png`  
- `Logical Diagram Update-2.png`  
- `Physical Model.png`  

---

##  **Key Features**

- Fully normalized relational database design (up to 3NF)
- Conceptual, logical, and physical data models
- Realistic sample data for schema testing
- SQL DDL and DML scripts for implementation
- Visual diagrams supporting design explanation
- Academic-level documentation and deliverables
